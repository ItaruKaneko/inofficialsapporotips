5. Sweets
   
   Sapporo is a place where fresh milk is produced, so sweets are especially delicious here in Japan. I think Japanese sweets are quite delicious. Below is one of them. This hotel offers afternoon tea for only 3,500 yen (30 euros per dollar), which I think is very attractive.

Or you can find other hotels using avobe mentioned url, which is Japanese hotel booking site.

### Air BnB

AirBnB also provide service in Japan. The price is not chap though, quality of the room is usually good. Plese check if host of the room can speak English. Japan is relatively safe country and there are minimum regulations for the safety for the AirBnB rooms. So it should be safe to stay AirBnB.

### Love hotels.

In Japan, there are different kind of hotels called 'love hotels'. Those are usually used for couples to stay few hours to spend private time. But you can stay by yourself for business purposes.
Please find detailed information. Design of hotels vary. But at least they has bed and very good bathroom. Note: No children. Some love hotels refuces male-couples.

### NEt Cafe

There are many internet cafes where you can enjoy manga, anime, and DVDs while maintaining your privacy. The price is quite low, so you can use it just for the stay. Some internet cafe rooms are equipped with a sofa (not a bed, so no bedding is provided). There are often shared showers. I probably do not recomend it but if you can not find any hotels just for one specific day, it can be the last resort.

## Bear

Bear
Sapporo is large city but surrounded by mountain. And in Hokkaido, there are many wild bears living in mountain.

In summer bear rarely come down to city area, because plenty foods in the mountain. Only in the fall and winter season, hungry bears come to city area. In April 23, only one bear is being observed.
